🐍 Summer of 2025 – My Python Learning Journey!

Hi there! 👋

I'm 9 years old (turning 10 soon!) and going into 5th grade. This summer, I'm learning Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world 🌍.

This is my special place on GitHub where I will:

    ✏️ Write simple Python code
    💡 Solve fun problems
    🧠 Learn about data structures like lists, strings, and dictionaries
    🕹️ Maybe even make a little game!

🧠 Why I'm Learning Python

Because it's fun! And I want to build cool things like games, websites, and maybe even robots someday 🤖.
📁 What You'll Find Here

    Simple Python scripts
    Practice exercises
    Notes I write to remember things
    Maybe some drawings or ideas I come up with too!

📌 My Goals

    Learn the basics of Python 🐍
    Practice every week during summer ☀️
    Share what I learn with others 🌟

🎉 Thanks for Visiting!
